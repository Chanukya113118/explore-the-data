			<td><p>Visualization is a technique for creating images, diagrams, or animations to communicate a message.It is important to visualize the data before any calculations are carried out. The visual representation can convey much more information when compared to descriptive statistics.Data visualization is the process of creating interactive visuals to understand trends, variations, and derive meaningful insights from the data. Data visualization is used mainly for data checking and cleaning, exploration and discovery, and communicating results to business stakeholders.</p></td>

			<td><p>Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. Data analysis is defined as a process of cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information for business decision-making. The purpose of Data Analysis is to extract useful information from data and taking the decision based upon the data analysis.In statistics, exploratory data analysis is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.</p></td>

			<td><p>A prediction or forecast, is a statement about a future event or data. They are often, but not always, based upon experience or knowledge. Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.[1] It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. A prediction from a machine learning perspective is a single point that hides the uncertainty of that prediction. Prediction intervals provide a way to quantify and communicate the uncertainty in a prediction. </p></td>
